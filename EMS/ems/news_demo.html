    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a demo-version of our experiment management system. This demo is intended to be a companion to our upcoming
    paper.
    The current pre-print version can be found at
    <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/12/18/012799">bioRxive</a>.
    In this demo Wardrobe functionality has been limited due to space and computational power constraints.
    Unlike the full version, users can not create new accounts or folders, cannot download new datasets and cannot run
    new analysis.
    However, users can view the datasets already there and view the results of analysis described in our paper.
    You can find a full version of our software at: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/genome-tools/">https://code.google.com/p/genome-tools/</a>.<br><br>
